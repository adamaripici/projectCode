# Getting Started with the Caraway Interface

The platform that we want our UI implementation to be graded on is a web interface.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Charlotte Andry - Worked on the Blog and Contact Us pages. The Blog page has 4 linked pages that show articles related to whichever topic the user would like to dive deeper into. These pages include articles related to topics such as Mental Health, Therapy, Helping Love Ones, and Practical Things To Try. The Blog page also lists 4 articles that are currently considered the most popular at the moment. The Contact Us page shows what Caraway's hours of operation are, along with ways to get in conact with the company. You're also able to send an email to the company directly from the Contact Us page, that'll give a confirmation when you press the sumbit button.

## Deviations From The Prototype

As a group, we decided to get rid of a couple things, according to suggestions from users that were able to test our interface. 

One of these changes includes our Management Tips page. At first, we would have users complete a questionnaire consisting of about 4 questions, that would allow them to get personalized recoemmendations for how to manage their mental health. Though, many users found it unnecessary and long. So we decided to take that out, and lead the user directly to some articles that are helpful for managing mental health. 

We also updated our footer, to give it more of a professional look. We used inspiration from other websites we've used in the past. However, we still included everything from the prototype, we just added onto the formatting a bit and added an About Us and Contact Us section. 

Another deviation we made was from the look of our origina Hamburger Menu. At first we had a white background, where allof our menu options were oriented to the left of the screen. Now, we have a grey background, and all of our menu options are oriented towards the center of our menu. Additionally our background does not dim when the menu comes up, mainly because we couldn't fgire out how to add this feature in. We decided to have this change, because of the way it popped compared with the rest of our, already white, pages.

Additionally with our menu, we decided to get rid of our Login and Contact Us options from our menu, because we didn't see many people making use of that when looking to log-in. Additionally, not too many people were looking to navigate to the Contact Us page, especially since we added the information to our new and improved footer.

For our newletter footer, we decided to add a vertical divider just to give a little more clarity as to where our page ends and our footer begins.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
